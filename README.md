This is my current practice project. This is for educational purposes only and I hope it would help PT students in the future.

This game was initially only a db app that would work as an exam type educational format. But upon learning of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities to make a game, I decided to try to implement my original idea into a multiplayer, like Fall Guys filled with mini-games but will test the PT student their knowledge of their profession mostly on the application part.

The game will be using Express.js, Socket.io and vanilla JavaScript. I am also going to try and make original assets for the game using maybe GIMP or AceSprite with Tiled Map Editor. Initially, I will be using the Modern Exterior assets for free by LimeZu at Itch.io.

This will be a long process and I hope to make it just fine.
